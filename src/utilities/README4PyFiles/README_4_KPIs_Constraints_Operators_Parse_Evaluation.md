---

## Overview

The `KPIs_Constraints_Operators_Parse_Evaluation.py` script is a crucial component of a larger framework that evaluates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and constraints in business processes modeled using BPMN. It provides parsing and evaluation functionalities for complex expressions involving KPIs, hard constraints, and soft constraints within a Process-aware Markov Decision Process (P-MDP) environment.

## Key Components

### 1. **Classes and Functions**

- **`KPI` Class**: Represents Key Performance Indicators used to measure the effectiveness of various process elements. It includes:
  - **Attributes**:
    - `name`: Name of the KPI.
    - `expression`: A string expression defining the KPI.
    - `stage`: Indicates whether the KPI is in the initial, intermediate, or final evaluation stage.
  - **Methods**:
    - `evaluate(context, dynamic_bounds)`: Evaluates the KPI expression based on the current state and specified dynamic bounds.

- **`Constraint` Class**: Represents constraints on the business process, divided into:
  - **Attributes**:
    - `name`: Name of the constraint.
    - `expression`: The expression defining the constraint.
    - `weight`: A numeric value indicating the importance of the constraint.
    - `stage`: Similar to KPIs, constraints have stages for evaluation.
  - **Methods**:
    - `evaluate(context, dynamic_bounds)`: Similar to KPI evaluation, this method checks whether the constraint is satisfied under current conditions.

- **`HardConstraint` and `SoftConstraint` Subclasses**:
  - **HardConstraint**: Defines strict rules that must always be met.
  - **SoftConstraint**: Flexible constraints that allow for some violation but impose penalties.

### 2. **Parsing and Evaluation**

The script provides parsing and evaluation capabilities for various expressions related to KPIs and constraints. Key functions include:

- **`parse_expression(expression)`**: Parses a string expression to a form that can be evaluated programmatically.
- **`evaluate_expression(parsed_expression, context)`**: Evaluates a parsed expression using a provided context, such as the current state or variable values.

### 3. **Operators and Logical Functions**

The script supports a range of operators and logical functions, enabling complex evaluations:
- Mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- Logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).
- Relational operations (e.g., greater than, less than).
- Conditional functions for dynamic evaluation of expressions.

## Usage

### **Initialization**
- Instantiate the `KPI` and `Constraint` classes with appropriate parameters representing your business process conditions.

### **Evaluation Processes**
1. **Parse Expressions**: Use the `parse_expression` function to convert string-based definitions into actionable evaluations.
2. **Evaluate Context**: Define the current context, including state variables and their values.
3. **Run Evaluations**: Call `evaluate` on KPIs and constraints using the context. The evaluation results can inform decisions within the P-MDP framework.

### **Integration with P-MDP**
- The script is designed to work within a P-MDP environment, allowing it to dynamically assess KPIs and constraints as part of the decision-making process.
- Adjustments to the environment can directly influence the evaluations, making this script integral to adaptive process management.

## Maintenance and Extension

- **Adding New Operators to P-MDP.**: Please the 'README_KPIs_Constraints_Operators_Parse_Evaluation.md' in details.

## Dependencies

- **Python Standard Libraries**: Basic functionality relies on built-in Python modules like `re` for regex operations and others for mathematical calculations.
- **External Modules**: Ensure compatibility with any modules or frameworks integrated into the larger project, such as state management or environment interfaces.
