## Overview

The `Create_PMDP_Environment_From_Graph.py` script is designed to create a Process-aware Markov Decision Process (P-MDP) environment from a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) graph. It facilitates the modeling of decision-making processes in business processes by integrating state and action spaces, and providing functionality to interact with the P-MDP.
